 Loan Approval Prediction Dashboard in Power BI 



I’ve built an insightful Loan Approval Prediction Dashboard using Kaggle data in Power BI. This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of customer behavior and loan performance. Here’s a breakdown of the key features:



-> KPIs:

1. Total Customers (Active and Inactive)

2. Total Loan Amount (Interest Rate % and Avg Loan Amount)

3. Avg Customer Income & Age

4. Performing Borrowers vs. Defaulters



-> Visuals:

1. 2 Donut Charts: Total Loan Customers by Loan Status & Performing vs. Defaulters

2.  2 Stacked Column Charts: Total Loan Customers by Age Group & Salary Group

3.  3 Stacked Bar Charts: Total Loan Customers by Loan Intent, Loan Grade, and Credit History (Years)



 -> Key insights at your fingertips with dynamic slicers for Loan Status, Age Group, Loan Grade, and more!
